          <span>CREATOR'S STATEMENT</span> 
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>It's Gonna Be Great!</span> explores the joys and pitfalls of becoming a woman. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This story makes the journey into womanhood easier and safer for today's young women (it deals with some intense #MeToo action). It is an important story, and I hope it helps. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote <span>It's Gonna Be Great!</span> After having a sleepover with my 13-year-old cousin. She was So Excited about boys for the first time and was sure that dating was gonna be great! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, I was exhausted by men and all of the problems that come from dating and being in love.
        </p>       
        <p>
          I thought my young cousin's optimism was so funny and tragic that I wrote a whole movie about it. (She has since had her heart broken for the first time.) 
        </p>
        <p>
          The real love story of <span>It's Gonna Be Great!</span> is between Sandy and her love rival Kimber.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I've become obsessed with men in the past, I've spent hours stalking women I've never met on their Instagrams, wondering what they have that I don't have. Why would he want her over me? And how can I convince him that I'm what he wants, and make him forget all about her?
        </p>
        <p>
          That's what <span>It's Gonna Be Great!</span> is about. It's about the obsession which forms between two women who are after the same guy, and ultimately, they learn they never needed the guy, and it was each other that they need. And that's beautiful. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This movie is the guide for thirteen-year-old girls (and boys) that I wish that I'd had at that age. It's the wisdom I've accumulated from all of my years of dating, and I've done a lot of dating, so there's a lot of wisdom to pass along.
