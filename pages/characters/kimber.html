          <span>THE Kimber Frankel</span> 
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>The boys wanna be her, the girls wanna fuck her <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i></span> 
        </p>
        <p>
          She's an Amazon Warrior trapped in the body of a 16-year-old cheerleader (technically flag line, but whatever). 
        </p>
        <p>
          She's ahead of her years in her knowledge of men and their motivations and she becomes Sandy's love coach and guru. 
        </p>
        <p>
          She's a genius. She's really into biochemistry and she's created a new strain of psychedelic mushrooms called “Kimber.” (Everyone said it was impossible, but she did it.) 
        </p>       
        <p>
          No one in her small-town is close to being her intellectual equal and her parents are assholes - those two things combine to make her a big problem. 
        </p>
        <p>
          She does whatever she wants. She sleeps with too many guys. She drives fast. She holds grudges and seeks revenge on her enemies – sometimes by having threesomes with their boyfriends. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of her behavior is coming from an unhealthy and sad place, but she doesn't realize that, and if you suggested it to her, she'd find some way to punish you for pointing out her fatal flaw.  
        </p> 
        <p>
          All of this acting out set aside, Kimber is a great and loyal friend... okay yes, she'll sleep with your boyfriend, but she doesn't mean to! And she's really sorry about that too, and she learned her lesson not to do it again.
